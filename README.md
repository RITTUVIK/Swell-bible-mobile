# SWELL Bible

Minimal Android Bible-reading app with Solana-based SWELL token donations.

This project is a simplified MVP built for the Solana ecosystem (Seeker-compatible) to explore how on-chain tokens can be used for reading incentives and peer-to-peer donations.

## 🎯 Goal
Build something real and shippable, not a bloated Web3 app.

This is NOT:
- A full DAO
- A social network
- A full-featured Bible platform

This IS:
- A clean mobile app
- With basic Bible reading
- And simple SWELL token interactions

## ✅ MVP Features
- Display Bible text (starting with Genesis)
- Track reading progress (local)
- Earn SWELL tokens for reading (mocked)
- Send SWELL tokens to other users as donations

Anything beyond this is out of scope.

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React Native (Expo)
- Platform: Android
- Blockchain: Solana
- Token: SWELL (mocked initially)
- Backend: None
